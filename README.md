# Nmap Network Exposure Analysis

This repository contains the results and analysis of a network scan performed using Nmap on a local IP range. The scan identified active devices and their open TCP ports using a SYN scan. The report lists common services running on these ports and highlights potential security risks, such as exposed vulnerable services that could be exploited.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the network devices on your local network and the security implications of open ports and services running on those devices. The Nmap tool was used to conduct a SYN scan to identify active IP addresses and open ports, which was then analyzed to determine the potential security risks associated with those ports.

## Scan Results
- **IP Range Scanned**: 192.168.1.0/24
- **Scan Method**: SYN Scan (`-sS`)

The scan results are summarized and the open ports, services, and associated risks have been documented.

## Analysis and Findings
This section includes the list of open ports, the services running on those ports, and the associated vulnerabilities.

- Port 22: SSH - This is a common target for brute-force attacks.
- Port 80: HTTP - Exposed web servers may have vulnerabilities if not patched.
- Port 443: HTTPS - Ensure certificates are properly configured.
- Port 3306: MySQL - Exposing database services is a significant security risk.

## Security Implications
Open ports can be exploited if not properly secured. It is essential to ensure that only necessary ports are open and that services are updated regularly to mitigate security risks.

## Conclusion
Regular network scanning with tools like Nmap is crucial for identifying potential security risks. This repository provides an analysis of the current network exposure and suggests remediation steps for securing the identified services.
