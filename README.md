# Nmap-network-exposure
This repository contains the results and analysis of a network scan performed using Nmap on a local IP range. The scan identified active devices and their open TCP ports using a SYN scan. The report lists common services running on these ports and highlights potential security risks, such as exposed vulnerable services that could be exploited.
